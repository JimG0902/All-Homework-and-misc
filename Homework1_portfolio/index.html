        <p> Paragraph about me
        Hello, I'm a senior Mainframe developer
        working on improving my skills by attending 
        UNCC's Web Developers boot camp.  I grew up 
        in Baton Rouge, La. and completed my education 
        at La State University. I've lived in Pittsburgh, 
        Pa for seven years before relocating to Charlotte, NC.
        I've lived in Charlotte since '96 and have worked in 
        banking my entire time here.
